This repository is intended for a project, but it is a template of my other repository called simple-node-app you can check my repository. Modifying the functionality of the app, but we start from the first repository since this was the first test so that it has a deployment in AWS (Amazon Web Service) this deployment is automatic since I am Solution Architecture I created a where Github Action system automatically clones to the EC2 service with SSH since this helps my software development team not have to enter the server to update the deployment and only I as Solution Architecture manage the AWS infrastructure. In addition to that, the script performs other important functionalities such as creating the .env file that I manage with secret variables and also when making commits an information card is sent to discord using webhooks.
